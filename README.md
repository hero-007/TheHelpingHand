A smart glove that converts Mute people's sign language into speech.
This will enable mute people to speak again.
It will be fast and smooth experience for the user due to its fast reliable communication between glove and user's mobile. 
Most importantly, this solution is really cheap i.e. it will not cost more than 2000rs if converted to a final product. 
It is a simple idea but can change people's life.
